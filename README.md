# Bolt.new: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development in the Browser

Bolt.new is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browserâ€”no local setup required. If you're here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the Bolt open source codebase, [click here to get started!](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## What Makes Bolt.new Different

Claude, v0, etc are incredible- but you can't install packages, run backends or edit code. Thatâ€™s where Bolt.new stands out:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by **StackBlitzâ€™s WebContainers**. This allows you to:
  - Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Interact with third-party APIs
  - Deploy to production from chat
  - Share your work via a URL

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models **complete control** over the entire  environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycleâ€”from creation to deployment.

Whether youâ€™re an experienced developer, a PM or designer, Bolt.new allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips to get the most out of Bolt.new:


- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Before sending your prompt, try clicking the 'enhance' icon to have the AI model help you refine your prompt, then edit the results before submitting.

- **Scaffold the basics first, then add features**: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.

- **Batch simple instructions**: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server, all in one go saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.
